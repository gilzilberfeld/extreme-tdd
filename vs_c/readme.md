# Description:
Extreme TDD Workshop exercises - Visual Studio C

These are the source files created in a project with Visual Studio and the VC++ compiler. The tests are written in C++ with the GoogleTest framework. There is also a [Eclipse CDT version with MinGW toolchain](https://github.com/gilzilberfeld/extreme-tdd/tree/master/cdt_c/) of the exercises.

Tests should run and fail.

## Created with:
Windows:        10
Visual Studio:  2019

## Prerequisites for workshop:
Visual Studio
If VS 2019 is not available, change the project settings to compile with earlier versions.
Diff tool: (I'm using [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/))
